                <p>At the end of my education at Dr.Kemal Naci Ekşi I decided to study Computer Engineering and follow my dreams.</p>
                <h3>University<sup>2015-2019</sup></h3>
                <p>In September 2015, I started my Computer Engineering education at Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University. First 2 years was heavily focused on algorithms and data structures.
                </p>
                <p>After that first 2 years of learning basics ,  I started focus on my interests. I was interested in various fields and developed myself for research. Topics I research are , Android Studio (I was trying to make an app for health and I learned so many things with this research ), Computer Networks and system security(MITM atack & how to prevent this and how to avoid these kinda attacks and various things like this) , Java (swing & spring) , C# extensions , Python (Image Processing and Machine Learning).And of course I improved my english in this process. </p>
                <h5>Internship One</h5>
                <p>In my first internship I worked on Java and PLSQL.I had very good experiences.That was my first time using PLSQL and
                    web servers.And i learned too many things.</p>
                <h5>Internship Two</h5>
                <p>I made a research instead of internship because of pandemic.My research topic was about RFID.Here is a my research. <a href="https://github.com/CKocoglu/RFID/blob/master/Staj%20Raporu%20(Cihat%20Ko%C3%A7o%C4%9Flu).docx" target="_blank">RFID</a> Explanation of RFID and answering some questions about it.</p>
                <h5>Graduation Project</h5>
                <p>As graduation project we did  <a href="https://github.com/CKocoglu/Plate-Recognition-System" target="_blank">Automatic car plate recognition system.</a>We did it with 2 person.And it's using computer learning.
                    </p>

                <p>That project teached me how to use object orianted programming in java and also making interface with java swing. That was my first complex project.And i did it by myself.</p>
                <p>My main goal was creating a Fitness member tracking system and connecting these informations to a specific id card.</p>
				
				<h4><a href="https://github.com/CKocoglu/Plate-Recognition-System" target="_blank">Automatic car plate recognition system.</a><sup>2019</sup></h4>
                <p>This project , recognizing car plates automatically with using computer learning. </p>
                <p>My main goal was creating a live car plate recognizing system.Firstly the program learning letters and words and then, It's comparing the pictures of car plates.At the end of the program , it's printing the car's plate.</p>
